## Workflow

1. Read DESIGN.md.

   - Decisions panel — bulleted list with strong styling.
   - Action items table with owner, due date, status.
   - "Open questions" + "next meeting" footer.
3. Subdued colour palette, clear hierarchy.

## Output contract

<artifact identifier="notes-name" type="text/html" title="Meeting Notes">
<!doctype html>...</artifact>
```
